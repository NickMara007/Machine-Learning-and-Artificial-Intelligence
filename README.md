# Machine-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository serves as log and demonstration of the work completed during the course of my Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at Imperial College London.

The course starts on the 16th of December 2025 and is due to conclude early in July 2026, so this repository will be updated as progress is made.
